git checkout HEAD <file> -this restores non .c files to pre patch state

git diff

more git checkout HEAD <file> for the files that don't
change string constants

vim <file> -to edit ' vs ` crossreference with git diff
(change all ` to ' in non string constants (comments))

vim src/diff.c.rej and src/diff3.c.rej files 
-compare them to respective .c files and apply patch changes (more ` to ')

git clean -f -removes untracked files

git status -to check for six files

git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt -generate newest patch

build process:
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

testing:
cd src
./diff . -
./diff --help
both correctly use only ' character
