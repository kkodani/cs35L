1) If the passwords are encrypted, then it should still be fairly secure,
though not totally.  If the passwords aren't encrypted, then the
observer could just look at all the bytes that pass through and convert
them to chars to find a password.  With a keylogger, this would be even
easier since you had to type the password several times, and an observer
could just look at the log and see that.  If booting with a USB, it is
possible that the USB was compromised, and changes (such as backdoors
or changes in security) were added to the USB files.

2) The --verify option only confirms that the signatures match.
You don't need to be the creator of a file to have the signature.
To fix this, one could use public/private keys in combination with
signatures to add another layer of security.
