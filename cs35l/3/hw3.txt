Q1: When the patch changed the default format from ISO
to traditional unix, it removed the line goto case_long_iso_time_style;
This line would gone to the line case_long_iso_time_style:
and set the default to ISO.  but with the GOTO line removed,
case_long_iso_time_style: was no longer necessary.

Q2: Other locales could potentially have the same or different problems.
Any script that was not in coreutils-7.6 (such as a user written one)
but still uses the ls command has also been affected by the patch, and
this may cause problems with those scripts.  The patch also doesn't
account for other languages/cultures, where the names of the months
and the ordering of the date may be entirely different.  The patch
however, does account for other locales that may specify a date/time
format, but if it is unspecified, it will default to the traditional
unix format.

Q3: Running the script on an empty file causes a IndexError: list
index out of range.  This is because the script tries to choose a line
to print, but there are no lines to choose from, not even an empty
line, so there is no index for each line either.

Q4: Running this script with python3 causes a syntax error on the line
except IOError as (errno, strerror):  This syntax assumedly was valid
in older versions of python but is not valid in python3.
