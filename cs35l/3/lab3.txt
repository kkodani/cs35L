Using wget, I grabbed the Coreutils 7.6 package.

used tar to unzip the files contained in the package.

made a new directory to install coreutils into.

used the configure command with the prefix option toast up the install.
	(prefix was the full path to the directory we want to install into)

used make, and then make install to compile and install.

went into the installed directory (coreutilsInstall/bin) and reproduced the
bug using ./ls -l.

copy and pasted the patch into patch_file, which i placed in coreutils-7.6/
directory.

ran the patch command patch -p1 < patch_file.
	(the -p1 flag makes the directories in the patch match the directories
for my
coreutilsInstall/ directory)

used make command to recompile.  make has to recursively check each file or
directory
in coreutils-7.6/ and recompile anything that was affected by the patch (such
as ls.c).

went into coreutils-7.6/src/ and used ./ls -l to confirm that the patch fixed
the problem.
